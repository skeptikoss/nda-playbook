RECITALS

WHEREAS, the parties have been exchanging each other’s non-public and proprietary information for the purposes of mutually determining whether to engage in a strategic or financial transaction between the Company and Investor (the “potential transaction”);
WHEREAS, the parties acknowledge and agree that the date of first disclosure of any such non-public and proprietary information was the “Effective Date”; and
WHEREAS, as a material inducement for the parties to continue to provide such information to each other for purposes of the potential transaction, the parties wish to (A) enter into this Agreement, (B) have this Agreement supersede and replace in its entirety all prior agreements pertaining to the confidentiality of each other party’s non-public and proprietary information that may be disclosed or used in the context of the potential transaction, and (C) have each of the provisions of this Agreement be effective as of the Effective Date. 
NOW, THEREFORE, for and in consideration of the mutual covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the parties agree as follows:
AGREEMENT
1.	The parties hereby agree that any and all provisions of this Agreement shall be effective, enforceable against each of the parties, and binding on the parties, as of the Effective Date.   
2.	In order to allow the parties to evaluate non-public and proprietary information for the purposes of mutually determining whether to engage in the potential transaction, each party agrees to deliver to the other and permit the other to have access to and use of certain non-public and proprietary business information related to the plans, prospects, products, properties (including, without limitation, intellectual property), finances and operations of the disclosing party.
3.	All non-public and proprietary information about a party (such as agreements, contracts, financial information, projections and business strategies) furnished by a party or its Representatives (as defined below) in response to requests for information by the other party or in the course of discussions between the parties and their Representatives regarding the potential transaction, together with all analyses, compilations, studies, summaries, extracts or other documents, whether prepared by the disclosing party, the receiving party or others, which contain or otherwise reflect such non-public and proprietary information, is referred to in this Agreement as “Proprietary Information.”  Proprietary Information does not include information which the receiving party can demonstrate (a) is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by the receiving party or any of the receiving party’s Representatives in breach of this Agreement, (b) was available to the receiving party or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by the disclosing party from a person who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party, (c) becomes available to the receiving party or its Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a person other than the disclosing party who is not otherwise bound by a confidentiality agreement with the disclosing party or the disclosing party’s Representatives or prohibited from transmitting the information to the receiving party, or (d) is independently developed by the receiving party.  As used in this Agreement, the term “person” shall be broadly interpreted to include, without limitation, any individual or any corporation, company, partnership or other association or entity.  As used in this Agreement, “Representatives” of any party means, collectively, its directors, officers, employees, agents, independent accountant, investment banker, financial, legal and other advisers, and controlled or controlling persons of such party and its affiliates.
4.	The receiving party will use the disclosing party’s Proprietary Information solely to evaluate the desirability of the potential transaction.  Unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the disclosing party, the receiving party agrees (a) except as required by law (including applicable securities laws), to keep all Proprietary Information confidential and not to disclose or reveal any Proprietary Information to any person other than those employed by the receiving party or acting on the receiving party’s behalf and directly participating in the evaluation of the potential transaction and who need to know the Proprietary Information for the purpose of evaluating the potential transaction, (b) to cause the receiving party’s Representatives to observe confidentiality terms at least as protective as those set forth in this Agreement and (c) not to use Proprietary Information for any purpose other than in connection with the evaluation of the potential transaction.  Each party will make reasonable efforts to control and segregate Proprietary Information received in writing from the other party to permit compliance with the obligations to return copies of such information to the disclosing party.  The receiving party acknowledges that the receiving party is responsible for any breach of the terms hereof by the receiving party or the receiving party’s Representatives from unauthorized disclosure or use of Proprietary Information.
In addition, each party agrees that, without the written consent of the other party, neither it nor its Representatives will disclose to any other person the fact that the Proprietary Information has been made available to it, that discussions or negotiations are taking place concerning a possible transaction involving the parties or any terms, conditions or other facts with respect thereto (including the status thereof); provided, that either party may make such disclosure as is required by law or the rules of any securities exchange or market by which such party is bound (in which event, to the extent practicable, the party proposing disclosure will consult with, and exercise in good faith all reasonable efforts to mutually agree with, the other party regarding the nature, extent and form of such disclosure).
In the event that the receiving party or any of its Representatives is requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoenas, civil investigative demands or other similar processes) to disclose any of the Proprietary Information of the disclosing party, such receiving party shall provide the disclosing party with prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so that the disclosing party may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive compliance with the provisions of this Agreement.  If, in the absence of a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of a waiver by the disclosing party, a receiving party or any of its Representatives is nonetheless legally compelled to disclose Proprietary Information of the disclosing party or else stand liable for contempt or suffer other censure or penalty, such receiving party or Representative may, without liability under this Agreement, disclose only that portion of such Proprietary Information which the receiving party reasonably believes is legally required to be disclosed, provided that such receiving party or Representative exercises, at the disclosing party’s expense, its reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such Proprietary Information, including, without limitation, by cooperating with the disclosing party, to obtain an appropriate protective order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Proprietary Information by the persons seeking disclosure thereof.
5.	If the receiving party determines that the receiving party does not wish to proceed with the potential transaction, the receiving party will promptly notify the disclosing party of that decision.  In that case, or in the event that the potential transaction is not consummated by the receiving party, or in the event that the disclosing party at any time prior to the closing of the potential transaction so requests, then, within ten (10) business days of such notice, event or request, (i) each receiving party will deliver to the disclosing party all Proprietary Information (and all copies thereof) furnished to such receiving party or such receiving party’s Representatives by or on behalf of the disclosing party pursuant to this Agreement; (ii) all other Proprietary Information prepared by the receiving party or its Representatives shall be destroyed and no copy thereof shall be retained; and (iii) a certificate of compliance with the foregoing shall be provided to the disclosing party by an executive officer of the receiving party.  Notwithstanding the return or destruction of the Proprietary Information, each receiving party and its Representatives (a) may keep one archival copy of such Proprietary Information (other than software source code) for its records related to the proposed transaction, and (b) will continue to be bound by its obligations of confidentiality and other obligations under this Agreement.
6.	This Agreement does not grant a receiving party any license to use the disclosing party’s Proprietary Information, by implication or otherwise, under any of the disclosing party’s patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property rights.
7.	Although the Proprietary Information contains information which both parties believe to be relevant for the purpose of their respective evaluation of the potential transaction, each party acknowledges that, except as provided in any final agreement with respect to a potential transaction, neither it nor any of its Representatives makes any express or implied representation or warranty as to the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information. Except as provided in any final agreement with respect to a potential transaction, neither party nor such party’s Representatives shall have any liability to the other party, any of such other party’s Representatives or any other person relating to or arising from the use of the Proprietary Information or for any errors therein or omissions therefrom and each party assumes full responsibility for all conclusions such party derived from the Proprietary Information.  Each receiving party agrees that it is not entitled to rely on the accuracy or completeness of the Proprietary Information and that a receiving party shall be entitled to rely solely on the representations and warranties, if any, made to a receiving party by a party in any final agreement with respect to the potential transaction.  Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as obligating a party to provide, or to continue to provide, any information to any person.
8.	The parties each agree that unless and until a definitive agreement with respect to the potential transaction has been executed and delivered, neither party will be under any legal obligation of any kind with respect to such transaction by virtue of this Agreement or any other written or oral expression with respect to the potential transaction, except for the matters specifically agreed to in this Agreement, and in any other binding written agreement by or between the parties.  In the event that the parties do not enter into a definitive agreement, each party will pay its own costs and expenses incurred in connection with the negotiations, including all legal and accounting expenses.
9.	Each party agrees that, without the prior written consent of the other party, it will not for a period of one (1) year from the Effective Date directly or indirectly (including through instruction to its agents) solicit for employment any person who is now employed by the other party and who is identified for solicitation as a result of receipt of Proprietary Information of the other party; provided, however, that neither party will be prohibited from making general public solicitations for employment for any position or from employing any current employee of the other party who contacts the party on his or her own initiative and without impermissible solicitation by such party.
10.	Without prejudice to the rights and remedies otherwise available to either party, a party shall be entitled to equitable relief by way of injunction if the other party or any of such other party’s Representatives breaches or threaten to breach any of the provisions of this Agreement.
11.	This Agreement contains the entire agreement between the parties concerning confidentiality of the Proprietary Information and the matter described in paragraph 9, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, negotiations and discussions, whether oral or written, of the parties pertaining to such matters.  No modifications of this Agreement or waiver of the terms and conditions hereof shall be binding upon the parties, unless approved in writing by each of the parties.
12.	This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea.
13.	If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable for any reason, it shall be modified rather than voided, if possible, in order to achieve the intent of the parties to the extent possible.  In any event, all other provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed valid and enforceable to the extent possible. 
14.	This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that both parties need not sign the same counterpart. 
15.	The provisions of this agreement shall remain in effect until the earlier of the date (i) that such information is no longer Confidential Information within the meaning of this agreement, (ii) that a definitive agreement in relation to the Investment is executed between Investor or its affiliates and the Company, and (iii) that is 24 months from the date of the execution of this agreement.

 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this Agreement to be executed as of 
the date set forth in the first paragraph of this Agreement.
