## ðŸš€ **CURRENT SYSTEM STATUS (9 September 2025)**

**âœ… CORE SYSTEM READY:**
- Algorithm processing real documents (tested with Claire's Korea NDA)
- "Change Party" button working correctly  
- Development mode fixed - no longer bypasses analysis
- All critical JavaScript errors resolved
- End-to-end workflow validated

**ðŸŽ¯ IMMEDIATE NEXT PRIORITIES:**
1. **Performance Optimization**: Improve Legal-BERT model loading speed
2. **Production Deployment**: Deploy to production and test with more NDAs  
3. **User Experience**: Minor UI improvements based on testing feedback

**âœ… COMPLETED PHASES ARCHIVED:**
- Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Sessions 1-10) - Database, API routes, UI components  
- Phase 2: Advanced AI Integration (Sessions 11-13) - ML systems, semantic analysis, user feedback
- Bug Fixes: Core system issues resolved (Session 14) - Algorithm validation, UI fixes
